# COMP 551: Applied Machine Learning Projects
This repository contains two sample projects I worked on in McGill's applied machine learning course.
Both projects include a writeup (report.pdf) that describes all the work done.

## Reddit NLP
This project consisted of classifying Reddit comments by originating subreddit based only on the written content of the comments.

## Modified MNIST Problem
A variant on the classic MNIST digit classification problem: given three digits superimposed on a noisy background, we try to detect the highest digit in the image. Involves interesting image segmentation techniques.
